This project is a connection and  translation module, including both front (Ionic framework based on angular) and back (Node JS express server + SQL file).

To launch it, run those commands in a terminal (make sure you've got Node JS installed and updated):

```
- npm i @angular/cli -g
- npm i @ionic/cli -g
```

- import the SQL file from /back/sql_file into your server and make sure you can connect from a local server

- go in the /back folder:

```
- npm i
- node server.js
```

- in another terminal, go in the /front folder:

```
- npm i
- ionic serve
```

Enjoy !
